# hello-world

This is my forst git.  I will likely be learning C++ to start an image processing suite that will allow fast and fully immersive correlative light and electron microscopy in one software for single particle.  This program will be written by a microscopist for microscopists.

I have added a description of my goals for learning how to code.
